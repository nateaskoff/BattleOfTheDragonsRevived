# BattleOfTheDragonsRevived

## Welcome all Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition PvP enthusiasts!

When I was growing up, I loved logging into Neverwinter Nights and playing on the **Battle of the Dragons** MOBA server. Of course, at the time, I'm not sure we knew what a 'MOBA' really was, but we sure had fun hacking limbs, slinging spells, and sneaking up for a kill!

I decided to go searching for the original mod on the NWVault in order to recreate this amazing experience, and hopefully build upon the amazing module first crafted by [Zorque](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/battle-dragons) and expanded upon by [ArBoFet](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/advanced-battle-dragons).

This module is a showcase not only in proper PvP balance and optimization, but in how even a timeless classic like Neverwinter Nights can be hosted on a modern Cloud Infrastructure provider like Amazon Web Services.

Build your character, join the fight, and may the favor of the dragons Aniel and Roshnak guide you to victory!
