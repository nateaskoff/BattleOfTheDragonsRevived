## Welcome all Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition PvP enthusiasts!

When I was growing up, I loved logging into Neverwinter Nights and playing on the **Battle of the Dragons** MOBA server. Of course, at the time, I'm not sure we knew what a 'MOBA' really was, but we sure had fun hacking limbs, slinging spells, and sneaking up for a kill!

I decided to go searching for the original mod on the NWVault in order to recreate this amazing experience, and hopefully build upon the amazing module first crafted by [Zorque](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/battle-dragons) and expanded upon by [ArBoFet](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/advanced-battle-dragons).

This module is a showcase not only in proper PvP balance and optimization, but in how even a timeless classic like Neverwinter Nights can be hosted on a modern Cloud Infrastructure provider like Amazon Web Services.

Build your character, join the fight, and may the favor of the dragons Aniel and Roshnak guide you to victory!

# Description

Battle Of The Dragons Revived is a 'MOBA' style game. The objective of the game is to defeat the opposing team's dragon. Players who join Aniel will fight against the forces of Roshnak, and vice versa.

The map's current itemization is fairly low-magic in nature, and so effects like damage resistance and damage reduction are incredibly powerful. Classes that scale exponentially at higher levels, such as sorcerer and cleric, tend to overshadow classes that scale more linearly, such as fighter or rogue. Some class combinations and itemization can help with this, but typically into levels 16+ the disparity is still noticeable. This will be addressed in future updates to the module.
